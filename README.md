# Test-driven-OO-example
This code was written in March 2015 to practice the principles of test-driven object-oriented software development.  It is written to answer questions about a rail network, which is given as a directed graph.


I used python.  I assumed that there will always be 5 towns and that they will be called A, B, C, D, E.

FILES INCLUDED:
main .py  --- this is the main piece of code with all of the classes and function definitions 

tests.py --- these are the test suites for the code in main.py

answers.py --- this is the script to run to generate the answers to the problem questions

testinput.txt --- this is a text file with the directed graph example given in the question 


TO RUN:
python answers.py

TO RUN TESTS:
python tests.py
